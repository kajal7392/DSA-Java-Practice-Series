This repository contains a growing collection of DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) problems solved in Java using three structured approaches:

✅ Brute Force → Better → Optimal

It is designed for:

📚 Concept clarity

🧠 Interview preparation

💻 Java practice

🔄 Revision and self-paced learning

🔧 Folder Structure
Each problem is in its own folder with the following layout:

Copy
Edit
ProblemName/
│
├── BruteForce/
│   ├── BruteForce.java
│   ├── BruteForceMain.java
│
├── HashMapApproach/ or BetterApproach/
│   └── ...
│
├── OptimalApproach/
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md → Explains problem, logic, complexity, etc.
✨ Features
🔍 Clearly structured code for each approach

📂 Markdown files explain logic and reasoning

📊 Time & space complexity for each solution

🧪 Sample inputs and expected outputs

✅ Organized for easy updates and additions

✅ Problems Practiced So Far
Sl.	Problem	Approaches Implemented
1.	Two Sum	Brute Force, HashMap, Two Pointers
2.	Second Largest Element in Array	Brute, Better, Optimal
3.	Remove Duplicates (Sorted Array)	Brute, Optimal
4.	Median of Two Sorted Arrays	Brute, Better, Optimal (Binary Search)
5.	Max Sum Subarray of Size K	Brute, Optimal (Sliding Window)

🔁 More problems will be added as I practice and grow.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Java-Practice-Series.git
Open in VS Code or any Java IDE

Navigate to any problem folder and run Main.java inside the approach you want to test.

📌 Why This Repo?
This is my personal DSA journey to:

Practice real coding interview questions

Learn how to write clean and optimized Java code

Maintain a digital notebook of solutions

Share knowledge with peers preparing for placements
