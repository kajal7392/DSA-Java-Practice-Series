# 🧮 Two Sum Problem - Java Implementations

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, return the **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to a specific target sum.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## 💡 Approaches Implemented

This folder contains multiple ways to solve the Two Sum problem using Java:

| Approach | Folder | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| 🧱 Brute Force | `BruteForce Approach` | Checks all possible pairs using two nested loops. Simple but less efficient. |
| 🧠 HashMap | `HashMap Approach` | Uses a HashMap to track complements. Efficient and works for unsorted arrays. |
| ✌️ Two Pointer | `Optimal Approach` | Fastest approach using two pointers. Works only on **sorted arrays**. |

## 🧪 How to Run the Programs

Each approach folder contains:
- A Java class implementing the logic (e.g. `BruteForce.java`)
- A separate `Main.java` file with sample inputs to test the solution

### 🛠️ Compile and Run
